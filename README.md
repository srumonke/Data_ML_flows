Objective: Create a Cloud-based Data Science / Machine Learning application, that includes:
1. Design and Development of a Data Pipeline: This includes data ingestion, preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, and monitoring activities.
2. Design and Development of a Machine Learning Pipeline: This involves model preparation,
training, assessment, and monitoring activities.
3. API Access: Access the application's details using APIs.

Sub-Objective 1: Design and Development of a Data Pipeline

Activities
1.1 Business Understanding: Identify a business problem in the area of data science.
1.2 Data Ingestion: For the identified problem, find an appropriate dataset from a public repository (Ex:
Kaggle). Ensure that the dataset has sufficient records to carry out a meaningful data science
experiment.
1.3 Data Pre-processing: Perform activities such as displaying summary statistics, checking for missing
values, imputing missing data for numeric columns, displaying data types, and normalizing data.
1.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to include calculating correlation coefficients,
identifying correlations between numeric and/or categorical features, binning, encoding, assessing
feature importance, and visualizing data (using charts and graphs for univariate and bivariate
analyses).
1.5 DataOps: Implement workflows to automate activities from steps 1.3 and 1.4 within a data pipeline.
Schedule these workflows to run every 2 minutes, logging all activity details and displaying them
on a Cloud dashboard.

Sub-Objective 2: Design and Development of a Machine Learning Pipeline

Activities
2.1 Model Preparation: Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for solving the business problem
based on the dataset. Select any two algorithms.
2.2 Model Training: Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets and train the models.
2.3 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using at least one metric (e.g., accuracy for classification
models).
2.4 MLOps: Monitor the model and log relevant metrics (at least four, such as accuracy, precision,
recall, F1 score, etc.).
